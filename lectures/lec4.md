## 📍 Slide 3 – 🔢 IP Addressing & Subnetting

* 🌐 **IP Address** = numerical label assigned to network devices, enables communication across networks.
* 🧩 **IPv4** = 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`), limited to ~4.3 billion addresses, now exhausted.
* 🔄 **IPv6** = 128-bit address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`), practically unlimited (~340 undecillion addresses).
* 📚 **CIDR Notation** = Classless Inter-Domain Routing (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`), combines IP address with prefix length to define network range.
* 📝 **Subnet Mask** = Defines which portion of an IP address refers to the network vs. the host (e.g., `255.255.255.0` = `/24`).

**Subnetting Example**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A["🌐 10.0.0.0/16 Network\n(65,536 addresses)"] --> B["🔵 10.0.0.0/24\nDevelopment\n(256 addresses)"]
    A --> C["🟢 10.0.1.0/24\nProduction\n(256 addresses)"]
    A --> D["🟡 10.0.2.0/24\nTesting\n(256 addresses)"]
    A --> E["⚫ 10.0.3.0/24\nManagement\n(256 addresses)"]
    
    B --> F["🖥️ 10.0.0.5\nDev Server 1"]
    B --> G["🖥️ 10.0.0.6\nDev Server 2"]
    C --> H["🖥️ 10.0.1.5\nProd Server 1"]
    C --> I["🖥️ 10.0.1.6\nProd Server 2"]
```

* 🛠️ **Common Subnet Sizes in DevOps**:
  * `/16` (Class B): 65,536 IP addresses - Often used for entire cloud VPCs
  * `/24` (Class C): 256 IP addresses - Common for network segments
  * `/28`: 16 IP addresses - Small subnets for specialized services
  * `/32`: Single IP address - Used for individual resources

* 💡 **Subnet Calculation**:
  * Available hosts = 2^(32-prefix) - 2
  * Example: /24 network has 2^(32-24) - 2 = 254 usable addresses

## 📍 Slide 17 – 🔄 Process Management in Linux

* ⚙️ **Process** = an instance of a running program with its own memory space, file descriptors, and execution context.
* 🔄 **Process Lifecycle**: Created → Running → Waiting/Sleeping → Zombie → Terminated
* 📊 **Process Hierarchy**: All processes descend from `init` (PID 1), forming a tree structure.
* 📚 **Historical Context**: Process concept introduced in early Unix (1970s), foundation of multitasking operating systems.

**Process States and Transitions**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: fork() / exec()
    Created --> Ready: Process scheduled
    Ready --> Running: CPU assigned
    Running --> Ready: Time slice expired
    Running --> Waiting: I/O operation / system call
    Waiting --> Ready: I/O complete / event occurs
    Running --> Zombie: Process exits
    Zombie --> [*]: Parent reads exit status
    Running --> [*]: Killed by signal
    
    note right of Zombie
        Process finished but
        parent hasn't collected
        exit status yet
    end note
```

* 📊 **Common Linux Signals**:
  * **SIGTERM (15)**: Polite termination request (default for `kill`)
  * **SIGKILL (9)**: Force termination (cannot be ignored)
  * **SIGHUP (1)**: Hangup, often used to reload configuration
  * **SIGINT (2)**: Interrupt (Ctrl+C)
  * **SIGSTOP (19)**: Pause process (cannot be ignored)
  * **SIGCONT (18)**: Continue paused process
  * **SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 (10/12)**: User-defined signals

* 🔧 **Advanced Process Management**:
  * **Process Groups**: Related processes grouped together for signal handling
  * **Sessions**: Collection of process groups, typically associated with terminal
  * **Daemons**: Background processes that run independently of terminals
  * **Init Systems**: Modern systems use systemd, older systems use SysV init
  * **Cgroups**: Control groups for resource limitation and monitoring

* ⚠️ **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**:
  * **Zombie Processes**: Dead processes whose parent hasn't collected exit status
  * **Process Leaks**: Applications creating too many child processes
  * **Resource Exhaustion**: Processes consuming too much CPU/memory
  * **Runaway Processes**: Infinite loops or recursive process creation
  * **Signal Handling**: Processes not responding to termination signals

## 📍 Slide 22 – 🔐 File Permissions & Ownership

* 🛡️ **File Permissions** = access control mechanism that determines who can read, write, or execute files and directories.
* 👥 **Ownership Model**: Every file has an owner (user) and a group, forming the basis of Linux security.
* 📚 **Historical Context**: Unix permission system designed in 1970s, based on military security requirements, still fundamental to modern systems.
* 🎯 **Permission Types**: Read (r/4), Write (w/2), Execute (x/1) for User, Group, and Others.

**Linux Permission Structure**

drwxr-xr-x 2 bob   staff       4096 Jan 15 10:30 my_directory
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root  root         755 Jan 15 10:30 script.sh
-rw------- 1 alice alice        512 Jan 15 10:30 private.txt

# File type indicators (first character)
# -  Regular file
# d  Directory
# l  Symbolic link
# b  Block device
# c  Character device
# p  Named pipe (FIFO)
# s  Socket

# Permission values
# r (read)    = 4
# w (write)   = 2
# x (execute) = 1
# - (no permission) = 0

# Common permission combinations
# 755 = rwxr-xr-x (executable files, directories)
# 644 = rw-r--r-- (regular files)
# 600 = rw------- (private files)
# 777 = rwxrwxrwx (full permissions - avoid!)
# 000 = --------- (no permissions)
```

* ⚠️ **Security Best Practices**:
  * **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
  * **Avoid 777**: Never use full permissions unless absolutely necessary
  * **Regular Audits**: Check for unusual SUID/SGID files
  * **Group Management**: Use groups for shared access instead of broad permissions
  * **Sensitive Files**: Protect configuration files, keys, and credentials
  * **Executable Scripts**: Be careful with execute permissions on scripts

## 📍 Slide 23 – 💪 Sudo & Privilege Escalation

* 🛡️ **sudo** = "substitute user do" or "super user do", allows authorized users to run commands with elevated privileges.
* 🔑 **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users only the minimum permissions needed for their tasks.
* 📚 **Historical Context**: sudo created in 1980 by Bob Coggeshall and Cliff Spencer at SUNY/Buffalo, designed as safer alternative to su.
* ⚖️ **Benefits**: Detailed logging, granular control, accountability, time-limited escalation, reduces need for shared root passwords.

* 📋 **Sudoers File Structure**:
```bash
# 🧪 Basic sudoers syntax
# Edit safely with visudo
sudo visudo

# Basic syntax: user host=(runas) command
# user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# ↑    ↑   ↑     ↑   ↑
# │    │   │     │   └─ Commands
# │    │   │     └───── Run as group
# │    │   └─────────── Run as user
# │    └───────────── Host
# └────────────────── User/Group

# Examples
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL                    # Root can do everything
%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL                        # Admin group can do everything
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL                    # Sudo group (Ubuntu default)

# User-specific permissions
alice   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl
bob     ALL=(www-data) /usr/local/bin/deploy.sh
charlie ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/apt, /usr/bin/systemctl

# Group permissions
%developers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/docker, /usr/bin/kubectl
%dbadmin    ALL=(postgres) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psql, /usr/bin/pg_dump

# Host-specific rules
devops  webserver=(ALL) /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx
backup  backupserver=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

* 🚨 **Common Security Issues and Solutions**:
  * **Overprivileged Access**: Use specific command lists instead of ALL
  * **NOPASSWD Overuse**: Only use for automated scripts and trusted operations
  * **Wildcard Commands**: Be careful with * in command specifications
  * **Path Manipulation**: Use full paths and secure_path option
  * **Shell Escapes**: Avoid commands that can launch shells (vim, less with !)
  * **Regular Audits**: Review sudo permissions quarterly

* 🔄 **Alternative Privilege Escalation Methods**:
  * **doas**: OpenBSD's simpler alternative to sudo
  * **su**: Switch user (traditional method, requires target user's password)
  * **pkexec**: PolicyKit's command-line tool
  * **sudo-rs**: Rust implementation of sudo (modern alternative)

## 📍 Slide 27 – 🔄 DHCP & DNS Setup

* 🏷️ **DHCP** = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration to devices.
* 🌐 **DNS** = Domain Name System, translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses and provides name resolution services.
* 🔄 **Integration**: DHCP and DNS work together to provide seamless network configuration and name resolution.
* 📚 **Historical Context**: DHCP standardized in RFC 2131 (1997), replacing BOOTP; DNS defined in RFC 1035 (1987).

**DHCP and DNS Service Architecture**
```mermaid

    participant DHCP as 🏷️ DHCP Server
    participant DNS as 🌐 DNS Server
    participant Internet as 🌍 Internet
    
    Note over Client,DHCP: DHCP Process (DORA)
    Client->>DHCP: DHCP Discover (Broadcast)
    DHCP->>Client: DHCP Offer (IP + Config)
    Client->>DHCP: DHCP Request (Accept offer)
    DHCP->>Client: DHCP ACK (Lease confirmed)
    
    Note over Client,DNS: DNS Registration (Dynamic)
    DHCP->>DNS: Register hostname → IP mapping
    DNS->>DHCP: Registration confirmed
    
    Note over Client,Internet: Normal Operation
    Client->>DNS: Query: example.com?
    DNS->>Internet: Forward query (if not cached)
    Internet->>DNS: Response: 93.184.216.34
    DNS->>Client: Response: 93.184.216.34
    
    Note over Client,DHCP: Lease Renewal
    Client->>DHCP: DHCP Request (Renew lease)
    DHCP->>Client: DHCP ACK (Lease extended)
```

* ⚖️ **Best Practices**:
  * **Backup Configurations**: Regular backups of DHCP and DNS configs
  * **Monitor Lease Usage**: Track DHCP pool utilization
  * **Secure DNS**: Use TSIG keys, restrict zone transfers
  * **Redundancy**: Deploy secondary DNS and DHCP servers
  * **Log Analysis**: Regular review of DHCP/DNS logs
  * **Update Serial Numbers**: Increment DNS zone serials after changes
  * **Test Changes**: Always test DNS changes before production
